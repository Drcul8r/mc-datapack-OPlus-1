Main code is located in: Data Pack Template\data\name\functions



Please replace all "name" files/ folders with your data pack name.
The following files/ folders must be changed:

Data Pack Template\data\minecraft\tags\functions : load.mcmeta
Data Pack Template\data\minecraft\tags\functions : tick.mcmeta
Data Pack Template\data\name




Info:

"load.mcfunction" will activate when you do "/reload"
"tick.mcfunction" will activate every game tick
"function.mcfunction" will activate when you do "/fuction <name>:function"

All files, when activated will run the commands from top to bottom all in the same tick.
Some example commands are typed out to show how they should be formated.

If you want to create a new function, please put .mcfunction at the end or it will not work.

"/reload must be done when changes have been made in order for the pack to update"
